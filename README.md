# On-line_Translation
The JetBrains project, Multilingual Online Translation Project
This is a fun project in which the program translates a word from one language to another. The program formated the call to https://context.reverso.net/translation/<from language>-<to language>/<word>, read the response and displayed selected results onto the screen. Learned how to use BeautifulSoup to search the CSS codes to find the content on the page.
